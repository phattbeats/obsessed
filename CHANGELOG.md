# Changelog

All notable changes to Obsessed are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Game-state concurrency: lock the in-memory GAMES dict** (`PHA-1338`). Per-room `asyncio.Lock` guards mutation of `GAMES[room_code]` and its `GameState` (scores, wedges, current question, status). Without the lock, concurrent `/answer` calls on the same game could each observe `all_wedges_earned() == True` and fire duplicate `game_over` broadcasts. Lock is process-local; multi-worker uvicorn is out of scope and documented in `app/services/game_engine.py`.
- `submit_answer` now rejects answers when `gs.status == "finished"` — prevents late concurrent arrivals from re-triggering the wedge-win branch.
- `get_or_create_game` is now async and acquires the room lock; `_get_or_create_game_locked` is the lock-free helper for callers that already hold the lock (avoids `asyncio.Lock` re-entrant deadlock). `cleanup_game` is async.

### Changed
- `create_game`, `get_game` promoted to `async def` to support the room-lock acquisition. Behavior unchanged.

### Added
- `tests/test_game_lock.py` — 10 tests covering lock acquisition, concurrent `record_answer`, wedge-win serialization, post-finish rejection, end-to-end concurrent answers via the FastAPI app.

## [1.0.3] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- `create_profile` now wires `threads_handle`, `instagram_handle`, `google_places_handle` — these were declared in model and schema but silently dropped at insert time. (`PHA-404`)
- Admin `/rescrape`: wrote to non-existent `p.content` field (fixed → `p.raw_content`), missing `google_places_handle` in scrape tasks, missing `scrape_places` import. (`PHA-404`)
- Static files mount at `/static` added to `main.py` — `/static/css/style.css` and `/static/js/app.js` were returning 404. (`PHA-406`)
- Deleted 4 redirect-loop stub HTML files (`host.html`, `play.html`, `profile.html`, `history.html`) — each meta-refreshed to itself, causing infinite loops. (`PHA-406`)

### Changed
- **WebSocket real-time game events** (`/ws/{room_code}/{player_id}`): lobby player list, game start, question delivery, answer results, and game-over now push to all players via WebSocket broadcast. 4 route handlers promoted to `async def` with `broadcast()` calls. Frontend `app.js` gains WS client with 3s auto-reconnect. (`PHA-407`)
- Game routes refactored as `async def` throughout (`join_game`, `start_game`, `submit_answer`, `next_question`) to support `await broadcast()`. (`PHA-407`)

## [1.0.2] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- `POST /api/profiles` 500 — `ProfileResponse` requires `entity_type` but `_profile()` in `app/routes/profiles.py` did not pass it, and `create_profile` did not propagate `data.entity_type` to the new row. Both now pass through `entity_type` (default `"person"`). (`PHA-342`)

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- `openlibrary.py` + `wikidata.py`: malformed stubs rewritten — orphaned `async with` and `write_cached` definitions outside try blocks removed
- `places.py` ↔ `google_places.py`: circular import broken, duplicate `aggregate_*` function definitions removed
- `rate_limiter.py`: missing `generic_limiter` export added (fallback path)
- `things.py`: missing `scrape_openlibrary_by_query` alias added
- `__init__.py` (database): `init_db()` moved to module level — was nested inside class body causing `NameError`
- `typing`: `tuple` → `Tuple` for Python 3.12 compatibility

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-02

### Added

- **Entity Cache Layer** — `EntityCache` table in SQLite; all scrapers check cache before HTTP calls. Cache miss scrapes and writes. No expiration. (`PHA-335`)
- **Search Fallback Chain** — Wikipedia REST → HTML fallback, OSM → GeoNames, travel → Wikipedia summary, GDELT/WikiNews non-fatal (`PHA-309`)
- **Rate-Limit Aware Pipelines** — `retry_with_backoff`, concurrent scraping, `RateLimiter` class (`PHA-310`)
- **Content Cap Raised** — 200K chars per scrape source (`PHA-308`)
- **People Pipeline** — Instagram, Threads, Pinterest scrapers with rate limiting (`PHA-295`)
- **README** — Project documentation (`PHA-344`)

### Architecture

- FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQLite (`trivia.db`)
- LiteLLM proxy at `http://10.0.0.100:4000`
- WebSocket live game events (`/ws/game/{room_code}`)
- Admin endpoints: `/api/admin/overview`, `/api/admin/cache/delete/all`, `/api/admin/cache/stats`
- Entity types: `person`, `place`, `thing`, `event`

### Deployment

- Multi-arch: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`
- Unraid: pull latest from Docker Hub → `docker-compose up -d`
